## Introduction

Modern manufacturing faces increasing pressure to improve efficiency and reduce environmental impact. This project provides a suite of SQL queries for analyzing key sustainability metrics using a hypothetical sustainable_manufacturing database. The queries are intended for use by data analysts, engineers, and sustainability managers.

---

## Dataset Description



The dataset includes the following columns:

- **Machine_ID**: Unique identifier for each machine.
- **Date**: Date of the recorded data (YYYY-MM-DD).
- **Material_Used_kg**: Total raw material used by the machine on the given day (in kilograms).
- **Material_Waste_kg**: Amount of material wasted by the machine on the given day (in kilograms).
- **Product_Output_Units**: Number of finished product units produced by the machine on the given day.
- **Energy_Consumption_kWh**: Total energy consumed by the machine on the given day (in kilowatt-hours).
- **Water_Consumption_Liters**: Total water consumed by the machine on the given day (in liters).
- **Water_Recycled_Liters**: Amount of water recycled by the machine on the given day (in liters).
- **CO2_Emission_kg**: Total CO₂ emissions generated by the machine on the given day (in kilograms).

**Each row represents one machine’s operational and environmental data for a single day.**
